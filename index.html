<p>The <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/debugger-protocol">Chrome debugging protocol</a> allows for tools to instrument, inspect, debug and profile Chromium, Chrome and other Blink-based browsers. Many existing projects <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/debugging-clients">currently use</a> the protocol. The <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/">Chrome DevTools</a> uses this protocol and the team maintains its API.

<p>The <b>1.1 version of the protocol</b> is the latest stable release of the protocol, tagged at Chrome 31. It includes a smaller subset of the complete protocol compatibilities.

<p>The <b>latest (tip-of-tree) protocol</b> <a href="https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-frontend/commits/master/protocol.json">changes frequently</a> and may break at any time. However it captures the full capabilities of the Protocol, whereas the stable release is a subset. There is no backwards compatibility support guaranteed for the capabilities it introduces.</p>
